# A PokÃ©mon minigame with JavaScript

## The plan: a PokÃ©mon minigame

It happens every so often: you wake up and get ready to travel to school / work.
You're late, but this annoying Team Rocket grunt wants to fight - and it's not like we can wait for a pandemic to cancel on-campus classes ðŸ¤”
So let's deal with it quickly and get it over with:
- A user can pick any of the starter PokÃ©mon
- Next, the computer will pick one for Team Rocket
- Lastly, we'll determine the winner (fire > grass > water > fire, you get it)

## The tools: JavaScript

So what is JavaScript exactly? If we take a look at the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript) on MDN, we find the following explanation:

> JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.

Confused? That's ok. For the moment all that matters to us is that it's a **programming language** and that it can be used to add functionality to web pages.

By the way, do not confuse _JavaScript_ with the _Java_ programming language. The two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.
